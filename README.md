COMMANDS:
Typing /[username] followed by your message will send your message as a reply to that user instead of a regular message.

WHAT YAPER DOES:
YAPER creates a universal group chat over your WiFi's local IP network, allowing only YAPER users to send and receive messages. This makes it ideal for communication between
multiple people across a large building or campus when mobile devices or mobile data are not available.

USER WARNING:
Do not send sensitive information such as passwords using this app. Messages are not encrypted and may be visible to technically skilled individuals on the same network,
including your building's IT personnel or internet service provider (ISP).

SCHOOL ADMINS READ THIS:
If you are a school administrator concerned about the use of this app, please note that newer versions of YAPER include a built-in message cooldown and a maximum message length to prevent students from
overloading the school's WiFi. If you are still concerned about message content, you can simply launch the app yourself to view incoming messages in real time. Previous messages are not stored;
they exist only as outgoing UDP requests and cannot be accessed afterward. If students continue to misuse the app or cause WiFi disruptions, speak with your IT department about blocking
LAN messaging apps that use the UDP (User Datagram Protocol) to prevent the use of this app and others like it.

I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT HAPPENS ON THIS APP, I DO NOT CONDONE THE USE OF THIS APP IN ANY BAD WAY I SIMPLY MADE AND RELEASED THIS AS A WAY TO LEARN C#.
